		<h2>Avocado Banana Bread Recipe</h2>

	<p>If you’re vegan or are allergic to eggs, you can omit the egg in this recipe. The avocado and banana also act as a binder so it’s ok to omit it. Leaving the egg out will give the bread a denser texture. This recipe for Avocado Banana Bread is paleo, gluten, grain, dairy and refined sugar free (with a vegan option). It contains 10g of Net Carbs making it also low carb (see nutritional info below).The avocado and banana together, gives this bread a light, moist and soft texture that is also not too sweet and goes along perfect with crunchy macadamia nuts.

The banana flavor is dominant, and I can hardly tell avocados are used in this recipe. If someone else had made it and gave me a piece to try, I would have never guessed the avocado was there. This is a good thing for me because I am not a huge fan of the taste of avocados.
